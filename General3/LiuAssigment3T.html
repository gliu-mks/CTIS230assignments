    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

<hr>

	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI am currently a senior at the Early College at Guilford. I enjoy hanging out with my cat, Mochi; 
		playing games; and the arts. I also enjoy playing the violin, which I have been studying since age 5.
		<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My biggest obsession these days is foodie culture. I've always wanted to be a food blogger, but 
		right now I'm starting simple. On my journey, I've dragged along friends to try out new drinks at 
		cafes and coffee shops. The most interesting drink I have tried so far is called "Bee Sting," which was
		very sweet latte with honey and cinnamon, found at Milk and Honey in Myrtle Beach. However, my 
		favorite find overall has to be the chai latte and "Green Peace" green tea found at Chad's Chai in 
		Downtown Winston Salem. The chai latte has the perfect balance of tea, sweetness, and spice while the 
		green tea is light and refreshing. 
		<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hopefully, I will continue expanding my foodie experience and help
		share the joy of food with others.</p>
